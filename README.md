MNIST Digit Recognition
This project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline to classify handwritten digits (0â€“9) using a neural network trained on the MNIST dataset. It includes:

Model training using TensorFlow/Keras

Digit prediction from static images

(Optional) Real-time recognition via webcam using OpenCV

All source code, model, and sample image included
